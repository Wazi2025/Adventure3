An old school text adventure in the style of Infocom using Classes, Objects & Lists. I was a bit hesitant in publishing this as it's not really a game at this point in time. But I figured some of you might be a bit curious regarding the progress since it's been more or less my selling point.

And there are, of course, 3 reasons why it's called Adventure 3:

1.Not enough coffee
2.To much coffee
3.We're getting there

In any case: enjoy.
